# Vendor-Performance-Analysis
A data-driven deep dive into supply chains, identifying $2.71M in stagnant inventory while mapping high-performing vs. high-risk vendors. This project pinpointed top-selling brands, prioritized high-margin 'hidden gems,' and isolated underperforming vendors with critical turnover issues using MySQL, Python, and Power BI.
